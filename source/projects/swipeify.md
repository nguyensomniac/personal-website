## Swipeify

My final assignment in a web design course was to make something cool. I love the user experience of Tinder, so I sought to replicate its simplicity in the realm of music discovery.

Like other music suggestion apps, Swipeify gives users recommendations based on an artist they select. However, users cannot pause, and they only have 30 seconds to decide whether to left or right swipe a song. The app also keeps track of the songs a user has right or left swiped.

The app is all client-side; I used AngularJS, HTML, and SASS.
