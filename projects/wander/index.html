<p>My project at <a href="http://2015f.pennapps.com/">PennApps Fall 2015</a> was a mobile app that matches people to potential travel destinations. Using the Ionic framework as a base, my objective that weekend was to design a straightforward UI that helps people book vacations faster than it takes to brush your teeth.</p>

<p>My final design was intentionally ambitious to build in 36 hours, and in the end we barely made a working prototype. However, it was a great exercise in going through the design process and rapidly iterating in such a short timeframe.</p>

<p>My team began by brainstorming why people choose the places they take a vacation to. We quickly discovered that the characteristics of an ideal travel destination couldn't be quantified easily, so I designed a Buzzfeed-style questionaire where users can check off characteristics of a travel destination that they liked. Throughout the app, I decided focus on using imagery to appeal to a sense of adventure.</p>

<p>I went through multiple iterations of the results display. I eventually went with the rightmost iteration since it gave the user insights as to why our algorithm chose the cities that it did. Instead of using a color scale that relied solely on hue, I decided to make lower-compatibility values slightly darker to increase color contrast.</p>

<p>Tapping on each city takes users to a page where they can book their trip. Our main focus was not to replace the functionality of existing travel booking websites - implementing advanced search features would detract from the purpose of our app. Instead, we automatically match you with the cheapest option we can find so you can book a plane ticket, a hotel, and a car rental with one tap.</p>
